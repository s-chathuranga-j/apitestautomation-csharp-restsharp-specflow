# API test automation with .NET 6.0 using C# > RestSharp, SpecFlow & NUnit

This is a .NET 6.0 project with dependencies:
- SpecFlow 3
- SpecFlow.Plus.LivingDoc
- Nunit 3
- RestSharp

## Setting-up the environment to Execute the code:
1.	Clone the project to your computer
2.	Make sure you have the dotnet 6.0 SDK installed in your system. 
3.	Open project using an IDE (JetBrains Rider IDE is recommended since this was created using this IDE on macOS)
4.	Make sure the plugin “SpecFlow for Rider” is installed in your Rider IDE if you are using this IDE.

## Executing the code:
1.	Locate the ArvatoAPI solution within the APITAP(API Test Automation Platform) Project.
2.	Open the ArvatoAPI solution & expand the “Features” folder
3.	Open the CheckAccountValidity.feature file where all the tests are written
4.	Click the small play button near the “Feature” tag of the file to execute all the test scenarios in the file.


## Test Results Reporting

This solution uses SpecFlow in-built reporting module “LivingDoc” for the reporting purpose. LivingDoc generates a HTML report with detailed test results. Additionally, the report also includes a section which shows some Analytics on the test execution as well. To use this test results reporting process, follow the following steps: 

### Generating the Report
1.	Setup the SpecFlow.Plus.LivingDoc plugin for your SpecFlow project (If you have created your project using the SpecFlow project template in Rider or VisualStudio this dependency should already be there)

Note: This plugin is only required if you want to generate living documentation with test results, otherwise you can skip this plugin installation and only install the command line tool below. In this example we will be generating LivingDoc with test results.


2.	Next, open a command prompt and run the following command to install the CLI tool, this is a mandatory installation:
dotnet tool install --global SpecFlow.Plus.LivingDoc.CLI

3.	Navigate to the path where your SpecFlow project is located.
cd {this part can vary on your machine}\APITAP\ArvatoAPI\bin\Debug\net6.0

4.	Now you can run the LivingDoc CLI by using the below command to generate the report.
livingdoc test-assembly ArvatoAPI.dll -t TestExecution.json

Note: TestExecution.json file is generated by installing the SpecFlow.Plus.LivingDoc Plugin for your SpecFlow project and holds the tests results. By default, TestExecution.json will be generated in the test assembly folder of your project when you execute your tests.

### Viewing the Report
Open the “LivingDoc.html” under the same above folder (test assembly folder) to view the report.
